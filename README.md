This is a 'The Odin Project' requirement project part of the Javascript Lessons.

The concept is to create a online library, where the user can input information about said book and it'll be registered in the page.

Used a clean, glassy design with a mix of flex and grid templates to set-up the UI.

In the JavaScript side, when a book is setup a card will appear with the book's information and two buttons: change status and remove card.

I know this project isn't approved on the accessibility side and it does have some minor bugs - that, for what I could test, didn't compromise the objective of the project.
